## brownian

Codes related to the tracking of Brownian colloids moving in a liquid and analysis of the corresponding individual trajectories.
The colloids are tracked by Mie holography. An example is shown below.

## soft_brownian_2024

Codes related to the analysis of experiments of confined diffusive colloids. More precisely, the codes were used in the following article: 

Fares, *et al.* "Observation of Brownian elastohydrodynamic forces acting on confined soft colloids." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 121.42 (2024): e2411956121.

## FPTs

Codes related to the target-reaching study consisting of the time it takes to confined colloids to reach an infitely-long target located at a distance $L$ from themselves.
